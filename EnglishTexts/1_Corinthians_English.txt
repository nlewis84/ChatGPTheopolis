1:1 paul called to be an apostle of jesus christ through the will of god and sosthenes our brother 
1:2 unto the church of god which is at corinth to them that are sanctified in christ jesus called to be saints with all that in every place call upon the name of jesus christ our lord both theirs and ours 
1:3 grace be unto you and peace from god our father and from the lord jesus christ  
1:4 i thank my god always on your behalf for the grace of god which is given you by jesus christ 
1:5 that in every thing ye are enriched by him in all utterance and in all knowledge 
1:6 even as the testimony of christ was confirmed in you 
1:7 so that ye come behind in no gift waiting for the coming of our lord jesus christ 
1:8 who shall also confirm you unto the end that ye may be blameless in the day of our lord jesus christ 
1:9 god is faithful by whom ye were called unto the fellowship of his son jesus christ our lord 
1:10 now i beseech you brethren by the name of our lord jesus christ that ye all speak the same thing and that there be no divisions among you but that ye be perfectly joined together in the same mind and in the same judgment 
1:11 for it hath been declared unto me of you my brethren by them which are of the house of chloe that there are contentions among you 
1:12 now this i say that every one of you saith i am of paul and i of apollos and i of cephas and i of christ 
1:13 is christ divided was paul crucified for you or were ye baptized in the name of paul  
1:14 i thank god that i baptized none of you but crispus and gaius 
1:15 lest any should say that i had baptized in mine own name 
1:16 and i baptized also the household of stephanas besides i know not whether i baptized any other 
1:17 for christ sent me not to baptize but to preach the gospel not with wisdom of words lest the cross of christ should be made of none effect 
1:18 for the preaching of the cross is to them that perish foolishness but unto us which are saved it is the power of god 
1:19 for it is written i will destroy the wisdom of the wise and will bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent 
1:20 where is the wise where is the scribe where is the disputer of this world hath not god made foolish the wisdom of this world  
1:21 for after that in the wisdom of god the world by wisdom knew not god it pleased god by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe 
1:22 for the jews require a sign and the greeks seek after wisdom 
1:23 but we preach christ crucified unto the jews a stumblingblock and unto the greeks foolishness 
1:24 but unto them which are called both jews and greeks christ the power of god and the wisdom of god 
1:25 because the foolishness of god is wiser than men and the weakness of god is stronger than men 
1:26 for ye see your calling brethren how that not many wise men after the flesh not many mighty not many noble are called 
1:27 but god hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise and god hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty 
1:28 and base things of the world and things which are despised hath god chosen yea and things which are not to bring to nought things that are 
1:29 that no flesh should glory in his presence 
1:30 but of him are ye in christ jesus who of god is made unto us wisdom and righteousness and sanctification and redemption 
1:31 that according as it is written he that glorieth let him glory in the lord 
2:1 and i brethren when i came to you came not with excellency of speech or of wisdom declaring unto you the testimony of god 
2:2 for i determined not to know any thing among you save jesus christ and him crucified 
2:3 and i was with you in weakness and in fear and in much trembling 
2:4 and my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of mans wisdom but in demonstration of the spirit and of power 
2:5 that your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men but in the power of god 
2:6 howbeit we speak wisdom among them that are perfect yet not the wisdom of this world nor of the princes of this world that come to nought 
2:7 but we speak the wisdom of god in a mystery even the hidden wisdom which god ordained before the world unto our glory 
2:8 which none of the princes of this world knew for had they known it they would not have crucified the lord of glory 
2:9 but as it is written eye hath not seen nor ear heard neither have entered into the heart of man the things which god hath prepared for them that love him 
2:10 but god hath revealed them unto us by his spirit for the spirit searcheth all things yea the deep things of god 
2:11 for what man knoweth the things of a man save the spirit of man which is in him even so the things of god knoweth no man but the spirit of god 
2:12 now we have received not the spirit of the world but the spirit which is of god that we might know the things that are freely given to us of god 
2:13 which things also we speak not in the words which mans wisdom teacheth but which the holy ghost teacheth comparing spiritual things with spiritual 
2:14 but the natural man receiveth not the things of the spirit of god for they are foolishness unto him neither can he know them because they are spiritually discerned 
2:15 but he that is spiritual judgeth all things yet he himself is judged of no man 
2:16 for who hath known the mind of the lord that he may instruct him  but we have the mind of christ 
3:1 and i brethren could not speak unto you as unto spiritual but as unto carnal even as unto babes in christ 
3:2 i have fed you with milk and not with meat for hitherto ye were not able to bear it neither yet now are ye able 
3:3 for ye are yet carnal for whereas there is among you envying and strife and divisions are ye not carnal and walk as men  
3:4 for while one saith i am of paul and another i am of apollos are ye not carnal  
3:5 who then is paul and who is apollos but ministers by whom ye believed even as the lord gave to every man  
3:6 i have planted apollos watered but god gave the increase 
3:7 so then neither is he that planteth any thing neither he that watereth but god that giveth the increase 
3:8 now he that planteth and he that watereth are one and every man shall receive his own reward according to his own labour 
3:9 for we are labourers together with god ye are gods husbandry ye are gods building 
3:10 according to the grace of god which is given unto me as a wise masterbuilder i have laid the foundation and another buildeth thereon but let every man take heed how he buildeth thereupon 
3:11 for other foundation can no man lay than that is laid which is jesus christ 
3:12 now if any man build upon this foundation gold silver precious stones wood hay stubble 
3:13 every mans work shall be made manifest for the day shall declare it because it shall be revealed by fire and the fire shall try every mans work of what sort it is 
3:14 if any mans work abide which he hath built thereupon he shall receive a reward 
3:15 if any mans work shall be burned he shall suffer loss but he himself shall be saved yet so as by fire 
3:16 know ye not that ye are the temple of god and that the spirit of god dwelleth in you  
3:17 if any man defile the temple of god him shall god destroy for the temple of god is holy which temple ye are 
3:18 let no man deceive himself if any man among you seemeth to be wise in this world let him become a fool that he may be wise 
3:19 for the wisdom of this world is foolishness with god for it is written he taketh the wise in their own craftiness 
3:20 and again the lord knoweth the thoughts of the wise that they are vain 
3:21 therefore let no man glory in men for all things are yours 
3:22 whether paul or apollos or cephas or the world or life or death or things present or things to come all are yours 
3:23 and ye are christs and christ is gods 
4:1 let a man so account of us as of the ministers of christ and stewards of the mysteries of god 
4:2 moreover it is required in stewards that a man be found faithful 
4:3 but with me it is a very small thing that i should be judged of you or of mans judgment yea i judge not mine own self 
4:4 for i know nothing by myself yet am i not hereby justified but he that judgeth me is the lord 
4:5 therefore judge nothing before the time until the lord come who both will bring to light the hidden things of darkness and will make manifest the counsels of the hearts and then shall every man have praise of god 
4:6 and these things brethren i have in a figure transferred to myself and to apollos for your sakes that ye might learn in us not to think of men above that which is written that no one of you be puffed up for one against another 
4:7 for who maketh thee to differ from another and what hast thou that thou didst not receive now if thou didst receive it why dost thou glory as if thou hadst not received it  
4:8 now ye are full now ye are rich ye have reigned as kings without us and i would to god ye did reign that we also might reign with you 
4:9 for i think that god hath set forth us the apostles last as it were appointed to death for we are made a spectacle unto the world and to angels and to men 
4:10 we are fools for christs sake but ye are wise in christ we are weak but ye are strong ye are honourable but we are despised 
4:11 even unto this present hour we both hunger and thirst and are naked and are buffeted and have no certain dwellingplace 
4:12 and labour working with our own hands being reviled we bless being persecuted we suffer it 
4:13 being defamed we intreat we are made as the filth of the world and are the offscouring of all things unto this day 
4:14 i write not these things to shame you but as my beloved sons i warn you 
4:15 for though ye have ten thousand instructers in christ yet have ye not many fathers for in christ jesus i have begotten you through the gospel 
4:16 wherefore i beseech you be ye followers of me 
4:17 for this cause have i sent unto you timotheus who is my beloved son and faithful in the lord who shall bring you into remembrance of my ways which be in christ as i teach every where in every church 
4:18 now some are puffed up as though i would not come to you 
4:19 but i will come to you shortly if the lord will and will know not the speech of them which are puffed up but the power 
4:20 for the kingdom of god is not in word but in power 
4:21 what will ye shall i come unto you with a rod or in love and in the spirit of meekness  
5:1 it is reported commonly that there is fornication among you and such fornication as is not so much as named among the gentiles that one should have his fathers wife 
5:2 and ye are puffed up and have not rather mourned that he that hath done this deed might be taken away from among you 
5:3 for i verily as absent in body but present in spirit have judged already as though i were present concerning him that hath so done this deed 
5:4 in the name of our lord jesus christ when ye are gathered together and my spirit with the power of our lord jesus christ 
5:5 to deliver such an one unto satan for the destruction of the flesh that the spirit may be saved in the day of the lord jesus 
5:6 your glorying is not good know ye not that a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump  
5:7 purge out therefore the old leaven that ye may be a new lump as ye are unleavened for even christ our passover is sacrificed for us 
5:8 therefore let us keep the feast not with old leaven neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth 
5:9 i wrote unto you in an epistle not to company with fornicators 
5:10 yet not altogether with the fornicators of this world or with the covetous or extortioners or with idolaters for then must ye needs go out of the world 
5:11 but now i have written unto you not to keep company if any man that is called a brother be a fornicator or covetous or an idolater or a railer or a drunkard or an extortioner with such an one no not to eat 
5:12 for what have i to do to judge them also that are without do not ye judge them that are within  
5:13 but them that are without god judgeth therefore put away from among yourselves that wicked person 
6:1 dare any of you having a matter against another go to law before the unjust and not before the saints  
6:2 do ye not know that the saints shall judge the world and if the world shall be judged by you are ye unworthy to judge the smallest matters  
6:3 know ye not that we shall judge angels how much more things that pertain to this life 
6:4 if then ye have judgments of things pertaining to this life set them to judge who are least esteemed in the church 
6:5 i speak to your shame is it so that there is not a wise man among you no not one that shall be able to judge between his brethren  
6:6 but brother goeth to law with brother and that before the unbelievers 
6:7 now therefore there is utterly a fault among you because ye go to law one with another why do ye not rather take wrong why do ye not rather suffer yourselves to be defrauded  
6:8 nay ye do wrong and defraud and that your brethren 
6:9 know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of god  be not deceived neither fornicators nor idolaters nor adulterers nor effeminate nor abusers of themselves with mankind 
6:10 nor thieves nor covetous nor drunkards nor revilers nor extortioners shall inherit the kingdom of god 
6:11 and such were some of you but ye are washed but ye are sanctified but ye are justified in the name of the lord jesus and by the spirit of our god 
6:12 all things are lawful unto me but all things are not expedient all things are lawful for me but i will not be brought under the power of any 
6:13 meats for the belly and the belly for meats but god shall destroy both it and them now the body is not for fornication but for the lord and the lord for the body 
6:14 and god hath both raised up the lord and will also raise up us by his own power 
6:15 know ye not that your bodies are the members of christ shall i then take the members of christ and make them the members of an harlot god forbid 
6:16 what know ye not that he which is joined to an harlot is one body  for two saith he shall be one flesh 
6:17 but he that is joined unto the lord is one spirit 
6:18 flee fornication every sin that a man doeth is without the body but he that committeth fornication sinneth against his own body 
6:19 what know ye not that your body is the temple of the holy ghost which is in you which ye have of god and ye are not your own  
6:20 for ye are bought with a price therefore glorify god in your body and in your spirit which are gods 
7:1 now concerning the things whereof ye wrote unto me it is good for a man not to touch a woman 
7:2 nevertheless to avoid fornication let every man have his own wife and let every woman have her own husband 
7:3 let the husband render unto the wife due benevolence and likewise also the wife unto the husband 
7:4 the wife hath not power of her own body but the husband and likewise also the husband hath not power of his own body but the wife 
7:5 defraud ye not one the other except it be with consent for a time that ye may give yourselves to fasting and prayer and come together again that satan tempt you not for your incontinency 
7:6 but i speak this by permission and not of commandment 
7:7 for i would that all men were even as i myself but every man hath his proper gift of god one after this manner and another after that 
7:8 i say therefore to the unmarried and widows it is good for them if they abide even as i 
7:9 but if they cannot contain let them marry for it is better to marry than to burn 
7:10 and unto the married i command yet not i but the lord let not the wife depart from her husband 
7:11 but and if she depart let her remain unmarried or be reconciled to her husband and let not the husband put away his wife 
7:12 but to the rest speak i not the lord if any brother hath a wife that believeth not and she be pleased to dwell with him let him not put her away 
7:13 and the woman which hath an husband that believeth not and if he be pleased to dwell with her let her not leave him 
7:14 for the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife and the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the husband else were your children unclean but now are they holy 
7:15 but if the unbelieving depart let him depart a brother or a sister is not under bondage in such cases but god hath called us to peace 
7:16 for what knowest thou o wife whether thou shalt save thy husband  or how knowest thou o man whether thou shalt save thy wife  
7:17 but as god hath distributed to every man as the lord hath called every one so let him walk and so ordain i in all churches 
7:18 is any man called being circumcised let him not become uncircumcised is any called in uncircumcision let him not be circumcised 
7:19 circumcision is nothing and uncircumcision is nothing but the keeping of the commandments of god 
7:20 let every man abide in the same calling wherein he was called 
7:21 art thou called being a servant care not for it but if thou mayest be made free use it rather 
7:22 for he that is called in the lord being a servant is the lords freeman likewise also he that is called being free is christs servant 
7:23 ye are bought with a price be not ye the servants of men 
7:24 brethren let every man wherein he is called therein abide with god 
7:25 now concerning virgins i have no commandment of the lord yet i give my judgment as one that hath obtained mercy of the lord to be faithful 
7:26 i suppose therefore that this is good for the present distress i say that it is good for a man so to be 
7:27 art thou bound unto a wife seek not to be loosed art thou loosed from a wife seek not a wife 
7:28 but and if thou marry thou hast not sinned and if a virgin marry she hath not sinned nevertheless such shall have trouble in the flesh but i spare you 
7:29 but this i say brethren the time is short it remaineth that both they that have wives be as though they had none 
7:30 and they that weep as though they wept not and they that rejoice as though they rejoiced not and they that buy as though they possessed not 
7:31 and they that use this world as not abusing it for the fashion of this world passeth away 
7:32 but i would have you without carefulness he that is unmarried careth for the things that belong to the lord how he may please the lord 
7:33 but he that is married careth for the things that are of the world how he may please his wife 
7:34 there is difference also between a wife and a virgin the unmarried woman careth for the things of the lord that she may be holy both in body and in spirit but she that is married careth for the things of the world how she may please her husband 
7:35 and this i speak for your own profit not that i may cast a snare upon you but for that which is comely and that ye may attend upon the lord without distraction 
7:36 but if any man think that he behaveth himself uncomely toward his virgin if she pass the flower of her age and need so require let him do what he will he sinneth not let them marry 
7:37 nevertheless he that standeth stedfast in his heart having no necessity but hath power over his own will and hath so decreed in his heart that he will keep his virgin doeth well 
7:38 so then he that giveth her in marriage doeth well but he that giveth her not in marriage doeth better 
7:39 the wife is bound by the law as long as her husband liveth but if her husband be dead she is at liberty to be married to whom she will only in the lord 
7:40 but she is happier if she so abide after my judgment and i think also that i have the spirit of god 
8:1 now as touching things offered unto idols we know that we all have knowledge knowledge puffeth up but charity edifieth 
8:2 and if any man think that he knoweth any thing he knoweth nothing yet as he ought to know 
8:3 but if any man love god the same is known of him 
8:4 as concerning therefore the eating of those things that are offered in sacrifice unto idols we know that an idol is nothing in the world and that there is none other god but one 
8:5 for though there be that are called gods whether in heaven or in earth as there be gods many and lords many 
8:6 but to us there is but one god the father of whom are all things and we in him and one lord jesus christ by whom are all things and we by him 
8:7 howbeit there is not in every man that knowledge for some with conscience of the idol unto this hour eat it as a thing offered unto an idol and their conscience being weak is defiled 
8:8 but meat commendeth us not to god for neither if we eat are we the better neither if we eat not are we the worse 
8:9 but take heed lest by any means this liberty of yours become a stumblingblock to them that are weak 
8:10 for if any man see thee which hast knowledge sit at meat in the idols temple shall not the conscience of him which is weak be emboldened to eat those things which are offered to idols 
8:11 and through thy knowledge shall the weak brother perish for whom christ died  
8:12 but when ye sin so against the brethren and wound their weak conscience ye sin against christ 
8:13 wherefore if meat make my brother to offend i will eat no flesh while the world standeth lest i make my brother to offend 
9:1 am i not an apostle am i not free have i not seen jesus christ our lord are not ye my work in the lord  
9:2 if i be not an apostle unto others yet doubtless i am to you for the seal of mine apostleship are ye in the lord 
9:3 mine answer to them that do examine me is this 
9:4 have we not power to eat and to drink  
9:5 have we not power to lead about a sister a wife as well as other apostles and as the brethren of the lord and cephas  
9:6 or i only and barnabas have not we power to forbear working  
9:7 who goeth a warfare any time at his own charges who planteth a vineyard and eateth not of the fruit thereof or who feedeth a flock and eateth not of the milk of the flock  
9:8 say i these things as a man or saith not the law the same also  
9:9 for it is written in the law of moses thou shalt not muzzle the mouth of the ox that treadeth out the corn doth god take care for oxen  
9:10 or saith he it altogether for our sakes for our sakes no doubt this is written that he that ploweth should plow in hope and that he that thresheth in hope should be partaker of his hope 
9:11 if we have sown unto you spiritual things is it a great thing if we shall reap your carnal things  
9:12 if others be partakers of this power over you are not we rather  nevertheless we have not used this power but suffer all things lest we should hinder the gospel of christ 
9:13 do ye not know that they which minister about holy things live of the things of the temple and they which wait at the altar are partakers with the altar  
9:14 even so hath the lord ordained that they which preach the gospel should live of the gospel 
9:15 but i have used none of these things neither have i written these things that it should be so done unto me for it were better for me to die than that any man should make my glorying void 
9:16 for though i preach the gospel i have nothing to glory of for necessity is laid upon me yea woe is unto me if i preach not the gospel  
9:17 for if i do this thing willingly i have a reward but if against my will a dispensation of the gospel is committed unto me 
9:18 what is my reward then verily that when i preach the gospel i may make the gospel of christ without charge that i abuse not my power in the gospel 
9:19 for though i be free from all men yet have i made myself servant unto all that i might gain the more 
9:20 and unto the jews i became as a jew that i might gain the jews to them that are under the law as under the law that i might gain them that are under the law 
9:21 to them that are without law as without law being not without law to god but under the law to christ that i might gain them that are without law 
9:22 to the weak became i as weak that i might gain the weak i am made all things to all men that i might by all means save some 
9:23 and this i do for the gospels sake that i might be partaker thereof with you 
9:24 know ye not that they which run in a race run all but one receiveth the prize so run that ye may obtain 
9:25 and every man that striveth for the mastery is temperate in all things now they do it to obtain a corruptible crown but we an incorruptible 
9:26 i therefore so run not as uncertainly so fight i not as one that beateth the air 
9:27 but i keep under my body and bring it into subjection lest that by any means when i have preached to others i myself should be a castaway 
10:1 moreover brethren i would not that ye should be ignorant how that all our fathers were under the cloud and all passed through the sea 
10:2 and were all baptized unto moses in the cloud and in the sea 
10:3 and did all eat the same spiritual meat 
10:4 and did all drink the same spiritual drink for they drank of that spiritual rock that followed them and that rock was christ 
10:5 but with many of them god was not well pleased for they were overthrown in the wilderness 
10:6 now these things were our examples to the intent we should not lust after evil things as they also lusted 
10:7 neither be ye idolaters as were some of them as it is written the people sat down to eat and drink and rose up to play 
10:8 neither let us commit fornication as some of them committed and fell in one day three and twenty thousand 
10:9 neither let us tempt christ as some of them also tempted and were destroyed of serpents 
10:10 neither murmur ye as some of them also murmured and were destroyed of the destroyer 
10:11 now all these things happened unto them for ensamples and they are written for our admonition upon whom the ends of the world are come 
10:12 wherefore let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall 
10:13 there hath no temptation taken you but such as is common to man but god is faithful who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able but will with the temptation also make a way to escape that ye may be able to bear it 
10:14 wherefore my dearly beloved flee from idolatry 
10:15 i speak as to wise men judge ye what i say 
10:16 the cup of blessing which we bless is it not the communion of the blood of christ the bread which we break is it not the communion of the body of christ  
10:17 for we being many are one bread and one body for we are all partakers of that one bread 
10:18 behold israel after the flesh are not they which eat of the sacrifices partakers of the altar  
10:19 what say i then that the idol is any thing or that which is offered in sacrifice to idols is any thing  
10:20 but i say that the things which the gentiles sacrifice they sacrifice to devils and not to god and i would not that ye should have fellowship with devils 
10:21 ye cannot drink the cup of the lord and the cup of devils ye cannot be partakers of the lords table and of the table of devils 
10:22 do we provoke the lord to jealousy are we stronger than he 
10:23 all things are lawful for me but all things are not expedient all things are lawful for me but all things edify not 
10:24 let no man seek his own but every man anothers wealth 
10:25 whatsoever is sold in the shambles that eat asking no question for conscience sake 
10:26 for the earth is the lords and the fulness thereof 
10:27 if any of them that believe not bid you to a feast and ye be disposed to go whatsoever is set before you eat asking no question for conscience sake 
10:28 but if any man say unto you this is offered in sacrifice unto idols eat not for his sake that shewed it and for conscience sake for the earth is the lords and the fulness thereof 
10:29 conscience i say not thine own but of the other for why is my liberty judged of another mans conscience  
10:30 for if i by grace be a partaker why am i evil spoken of for that for which i give thanks  
10:31 whether therefore ye eat or drink or whatsoever ye do do all to the glory of god 
10:32 give none offence neither to the jews nor to the gentiles nor to the church of god 
10:33 even as i please all men in all things not seeking mine own profit but the profit of many that they may be saved 
11:1 be ye followers of me even as i also am of christ 
11:2 now i praise you brethren that ye remember me in all things and keep the ordinances as i delivered them to you 
11:3 but i would have you know that the head of every man is christ and the head of the woman is the man and the head of christ is god 
11:4 every man praying or prophesying having his head covered dishonoureth his head 
11:5 but every woman that prayeth or prophesieth with her head uncovered dishonoureth her head for that is even all one as if she were shaven 
11:6 for if the woman be not covered let her also be shorn but if it be a shame for a woman to be shorn or shaven let her be covered 
11:7 for a man indeed ought not to cover his head forasmuch as he is the image and glory of god but the woman is the glory of the man 
11:8 for the man is not of the woman but the woman of the man 
11:9 neither was the man created for the woman but the woman for the man 
11:10 for this cause ought the woman to have power on her head because of the angels 
11:11 nevertheless neither is the man without the woman neither the woman without the man in the lord 
11:12 for as the woman is of the man even so is the man also by the woman but all things of god 
11:13 judge in yourselves is it comely that a woman pray unto god uncovered  
11:14 doth not even nature itself teach you that if a man have long hair it is a shame unto him  
11:15 but if a woman have long hair it is a glory to her for her hair is given her for a covering 
11:16 but if any man seem to be contentious we have no such custom neither the churches of god 
11:17 now in this that i declare unto you i praise you not that ye come together not for the better but for the worse 
11:18 for first of all when ye come together in the church i hear that there be divisions among you and i partly believe it 
11:19 for there must be also heresies among you that they which are approved may be made manifest among you 
11:20 when ye come together therefore into one place this is not to eat the lords supper 
11:21 for in eating every one taketh before other his own supper and one is hungry and another is drunken 
11:22 what have ye not houses to eat and to drink in or despise ye the church of god and shame them that have not what shall i say to you shall i praise you in this i praise you not 
11:23 for i have received of the lord that which also i delivered unto you that the lord jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread 
11:24 and when he had given thanks he brake it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this do in remembrance of me 
11:25 after the same manner also he took the cup when he had supped saying this cup is the new testament in my blood this do ye as oft as ye drink it in remembrance of me 
11:26 for as often as ye eat this bread and drink this cup ye do shew the lords death till he come 
11:27 wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the lord 
11:28 but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup 
11:29 for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh damnation to himself not discerning the lords body 
11:30 for this cause many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep 
11:31 for if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged 
11:32 but when we are judged we are chastened of the lord that we should not be condemned with the world 
11:33 wherefore my brethren when ye come together to eat tarry one for another 
11:34 and if any man hunger let him eat at home that ye come not together unto condemnation and the rest will i set in order when i come 
12:1 now concerning spiritual gifts brethren i would not have you ignorant 
12:2 ye know that ye were gentiles carried away unto these dumb idols even as ye were led 
12:3 wherefore i give you to understand that no man speaking by the spirit of god calleth jesus accursed and that no man can say that jesus is the lord but by the holy ghost 
12:4 now there are diversities of gifts but the same spirit 
12:5 and there are differences of administrations but the same lord 
12:6 and there are diversities of operations but it is the same god which worketh all in all 
12:7 but the manifestation of the spirit is given to every man to profit withal 
12:8 for to one is given by the spirit the word of wisdom to another the word of knowledge by the same spirit 
12:9 to another faith by the same spirit to another the gifts of healing by the same spirit 
12:10 to another the working of miracles to another prophecy to another discerning of spirits to another divers kinds of tongues to another the interpretation of tongues 
12:11 but all these worketh that one and the selfsame spirit dividing to every man severally as he will 
12:12 for as the body is one and hath many members and all the members of that one body being many are one body so also is christ 
12:13 for by one spirit are we all baptized into one body whether we be jews or gentiles whether we be bond or free and have been all made to drink into one spirit 
12:14 for the body is not one member but many 
12:15 if the foot shall say because i am not the hand i am not of the body is it therefore not of the body  
12:16 and if the ear shall say because i am not the eye i am not of the body is it therefore not of the body  
12:17 if the whole body were an eye where were the hearing if the whole were hearing where were the smelling  
12:18 but now hath god set the members every one of them in the body as it hath pleased him 
12:19 and if they were all one member where were the body  
12:20 but now are they many members yet but one body 
12:21 and the eye cannot say unto the hand i have no need of thee nor again the head to the feet i have no need of you 
12:22 nay much more those members of the body which seem to be more feeble are necessary 
12:23 and those members of the body which we think to be less honourable upon these we bestow more abundant honour and our uncomely parts have more abundant comeliness 
12:24 for our comely parts have no need but god hath tempered the body together having given more abundant honour to that part which lacked 
12:25 that there should be no schism in the body but that the members should have the same care one for another 
12:26 and whether one member suffer all the members suffer with it or one member be honoured all the members rejoice with it 
12:27 now ye are the body of christ and members in particular 
12:28 and god hath set some in the church first apostles secondarily prophets thirdly teachers after that miracles then gifts of healings helps governments diversities of tongues 
12:29 are all apostles are all prophets are all teachers are all workers of miracles  
12:30 have all the gifts of healing do all speak with tongues do all interpret  
12:31 but covet earnestly the best gifts and yet shew i unto you a more excellent way 
13:1 though i speak with the tongues of men and of angels and have not charity i am become as sounding brass or a tinkling cymbal 
13:2 and though i have the gift of prophecy and understand all mysteries and all knowledge and though i have all faith so that i could remove mountains and have not charity i am nothing 
13:3 and though i bestow all my goods to feed the poor and though i give my body to be burned and have not charity it profiteth me nothing 
13:4 charity suffereth long and is kind charity envieth not charity vaunteth not itself is not puffed up 
13:5 doth not behave itself unseemly seeketh not her own is not easily provoked thinketh no evil 
13:6 rejoiceth not in iniquity but rejoiceth in the truth 
13:7 beareth all things believeth all things hopeth all things endureth all things 
13:8 charity never faileth but whether there be prophecies they shall fail whether there be tongues they shall cease whether there be knowledge it shall vanish away 
13:9 for we know in part and we prophesy in part 
13:10 but when that which is perfect is come then that which is in part shall be done away 
13:11 when i was a child i spake as a child i understood as a child i thought as a child but when i became a man i put away childish things 
13:12 for now we see through a glass darkly but then face to face now i know in part but then shall i know even as also i am known 
13:13 and now abideth faith hope charity these three but the greatest of these is charity 
14:1 follow after charity and desire spiritual gifts but rather that ye may prophesy 
14:2 for he that speaketh in an unknown tongue speaketh not unto men but unto god for no man understandeth him howbeit in the spirit he speaketh mysteries 
14:3 but he that prophesieth speaketh unto men to edification and exhortation and comfort 
14:4 he that speaketh in an unknown tongue edifieth himself but he that prophesieth edifieth the church 
14:5 i would that ye all spake with tongues but rather that ye prophesied for greater is he that prophesieth than he that speaketh with tongues except he interpret that the church may receive edifying 
14:6 now brethren if i come unto you speaking with tongues what shall i profit you except i shall speak to you either by revelation or by knowledge or by prophesying or by doctrine  
14:7 and even things without life giving sound whether pipe or harp except they give a distinction in the sounds how shall it be known what is piped or harped  
14:8 for if the trumpet give an uncertain sound who shall prepare himself to the battle  
14:9 so likewise ye except ye utter by the tongue words easy to be understood how shall it be known what is spoken for ye shall speak into the air 
14:10 there are it may be so many kinds of voices in the world and none of them is without signification 
14:11 therefore if i know not the meaning of the voice i shall be unto him that speaketh a barbarian and he that speaketh shall be a barbarian unto me 
14:12 even so ye forasmuch as ye are zealous of spiritual gifts seek that ye may excel to the edifying of the church 
14:13 wherefore let him that speaketh in an unknown tongue pray that he may interpret 
14:14 for if i pray in an unknown tongue my spirit prayeth but my understanding is unfruitful 
14:15 what is it then i will pray with the spirit and i will pray with the understanding also i will sing with the spirit and i will sing with the understanding also 
14:16 else when thou shalt bless with the spirit how shall he that occupieth the room of the unlearned say amen at thy giving of thanks seeing he understandeth not what thou sayest  
14:17 for thou verily givest thanks well but the other is not edified 
14:18 i thank my god i speak with tongues more than ye all 
14:19 yet in the church i had rather speak five words with my understanding that by my voice i might teach others also than ten thousand words in an unknown tongue 
14:20 brethren be not children in understanding howbeit in malice be ye children but in understanding be men 
14:21 in the law it is written with men of other tongues and other lips will i speak unto this people and yet for all that will they not hear me saith the lord 
14:22 wherefore tongues are for a sign not to them that believe but to them that believe not but prophesying serveth not for them that believe not but for them which believe 
14:23 if therefore the whole church be come together into one place and all speak with tongues and there come in those that are unlearned or unbelievers will they not say that ye are mad  
14:24 but if all prophesy and there come in one that believeth not or one unlearned he is convinced of all he is judged of all 
14:25 and thus are the secrets of his heart made manifest and so falling down on his face he will worship god and report that god is in you of a truth 
14:26 how is it then brethren when ye come together every one of you hath a psalm hath a doctrine hath a tongue hath a revelation hath an interpretation let all things be done unto edifying 
14:27 if any man speak in an unknown tongue let it be by two or at the most by three and that by course and let one interpret 
14:28 but if there be no interpreter let him keep silence in the church and let him speak to himself and to god 
14:29 let the prophets speak two or three and let the other judge 
14:30 if any thing be revealed to another that sitteth by let the first hold his peace 
14:31 for ye may all prophesy one by one that all may learn and all may be comforted 
14:32 and the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets 
14:33 for god is not the author of confusion but of peace as in all churches of the saints 
14:34 let your women keep silence in the churches for it is not permitted unto them to speak but they are commanded to be under obedience as also saith the law 
14:35 and if they will learn any thing let them ask their husbands at home for it is a shame for women to speak in the church 
14:36 what came the word of god out from you or came it unto you only  
14:37 if any man think himself to be a prophet or spiritual let him acknowledge that the things that i write unto you are the commandments of the lord 
14:38 but if any man be ignorant let him be ignorant 
14:39 wherefore brethren covet to prophesy and forbid not to speak with tongues 
14:40 let all things be done decently and in order 
15:1 moreover brethren i declare unto you the gospel which i preached unto you which also ye have received and wherein ye stand 
15:2 by which also ye are saved if ye keep in memory what i preached unto you unless ye have believed in vain 
15:3 for i delivered unto you first of all that which i also received how that christ died for our sins according to the scriptures 
15:4 and that he was buried and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures 
15:5 and that he was seen of cephas then of the twelve 
15:6 after that he was seen of above five hundred brethren at once of whom the greater part remain unto this present but some are fallen asleep 
15:7 after that he was seen of james then of all the apostles 
15:8 and last of all he was seen of me also as of one born out of due time 
15:9 for i am the least of the apostles that am not meet to be called an apostle because i persecuted the church of god 
15:10 but by the grace of god i am what i am and his grace which was bestowed upon me was not in vain but i laboured more abundantly than they all yet not i but the grace of god which was with me 
15:11 therefore whether it were i or they so we preach and so ye believed 
15:12 now if christ be preached that he rose from the dead how say some among you that there is no resurrection of the dead  
15:13 but if there be no resurrection of the dead then is christ not risen 
15:14 and if christ be not risen then is our preaching vain and your faith is also vain 
15:15 yea and we are found false witnesses of god because we have testified of god that he raised up christ whom he raised not up if so be that the dead rise not 
15:16 for if the dead rise not then is not christ raised 
15:17 and if christ be not raised your faith is vain ye are yet in your sins 
15:18 then they also which are fallen asleep in christ are perished 
15:19 if in this life only we have hope in christ we are of all men most miserable 
15:20 but now is christ risen from the dead and become the firstfruits of them that slept 
15:21 for since by man came death by man came also the resurrection of the dead 
15:22 for as in adam all die even so in christ shall all be made alive 
15:23 but every man in his own order christ the firstfruits afterward they that are christs at his coming 
15:24 then cometh the end when he shall have delivered up the kingdom to god even the father when he shall have put down all rule and all authority and power 
15:25 for he must reign till he hath put all enemies under his feet 
15:26 the last enemy that shall be destroyed is death 
15:27 for he hath put all things under his feet but when he saith all things are put under him it is manifest that he is excepted which did put all things under him 
15:28 and when all things shall be subdued unto him then shall the son also himself be subject unto him that put all things under him that god may be all in all 
15:29 else what shall they do which are baptized for the dead if the dead rise not at all why are they then baptized for the dead  
15:30 and why stand we in jeopardy every hour  
15:31 i protest by your rejoicing which i have in christ jesus our lord i die daily 
15:32 if after the manner of men i have fought with beasts at ephesus what advantageth it me if the dead rise not let us eat and drink for to morrow we die 
15:33 be not deceived evil communications corrupt good manners 
15:34 awake to righteousness and sin not for some have not the knowledge of god i speak this to your shame 
15:35 but some man will say how are the dead raised up and with what body do they come  
15:36 thou fool that which thou sowest is not quickened except it die 
15:37 and that which thou sowest thou sowest not that body that shall be but bare grain it may chance of wheat or of some other grain 
15:38 but god giveth it a body as it hath pleased him and to every seed his own body 
15:39 all flesh is not the same flesh but there is one kind of flesh of men another flesh of beasts another of fishes and another of birds 
15:40 there are also celestial bodies and bodies terrestrial but the glory of the celestial is one and the glory of the terrestrial is another 
15:41 there is one glory of the sun and another glory of the moon and another glory of the stars for one star differeth from another star in glory 
15:42 so also is the resurrection of the dead it is sown in corruption it is raised in incorruption 
15:43 it is sown in dishonour it is raised in glory it is sown in weakness it is raised in power 
15:44 it is sown a natural body it is raised a spiritual body there is a natural body and there is a spiritual body 
15:45 and so it is written the first man adam was made a living soul the last adam was made a quickening spirit 
15:46 howbeit that was not first which is spiritual but that which is natural and afterward that which is spiritual 
15:47 the first man is of the earth earthy the second man is the lord from heaven 
15:48 as is the earthy such are they also that are earthy and as is the heavenly such are they also that are heavenly 
15:49 and as we have borne the image of the earthy we shall also bear the image of the heavenly 
15:50 now this i say brethren that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of god neither doth corruption inherit incorruption 
15:51 behold i shew you a mystery we shall not all sleep but we shall all be changed 
15:52 in a moment in the twinkling of an eye at the last trump for the trumpet shall sound and the dead shall be raised incorruptible and we shall be changed 
15:53 for this corruptible must put on incorruption and this mortal must put on immortality 
15:54 so when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption and this mortal shall have put on immortality then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written death is swallowed up in victory 
15:55 o death where is thy sting o grave where is thy victory 
15:56 the sting of death is sin and the strength of sin is the law 
15:57 but thanks be to god which giveth us the victory through our lord jesus christ 
15:58 therefore my beloved brethren be ye stedfast unmoveable always abounding in the work of the lord forasmuch as ye know that your labour is not in vain in the lord 
16:1 now concerning the collection for the saints as i have given order to the churches of galatia even so do ye 
16:2 upon the first day of the week let every one of you lay by him in store as god hath prospered him that there be no gatherings when i come 
16:3 and when i come whomsoever ye shall approve by your letters them will i send to bring your liberality unto jerusalem 
16:4 and if it be meet that i go also they shall go with me 
16:5 now i will come unto you when i shall pass through macedonia for i do pass through macedonia 
16:6 and it may be that i will abide yea and winter with you that ye may bring me on my journey whithersoever i go 
16:7 for i will not see you now by the way but i trust to tarry a while with you if the lord permit 
16:8 but i will tarry at ephesus until pentecost 
16:9 for a great door and effectual is opened unto me and there are many adversaries 
16:10 now if timotheus come see that he may be with you without fear for he worketh the work of the lord as i also do 
16:11 let no man therefore despise him but conduct him forth in peace that he may come unto me for i look for him with the brethren 
16:12 as touching our brother apollos i greatly desired him to come unto you with the brethren but his will was not at all to come at this time but he will come when he shall have convenient time 
16:13 watch ye stand fast in the faith quit you like men be strong 
16:14 let all your things be done with charity 
16:15 i beseech you brethren ye know the house of stephanas that it is the firstfruits of achaia and that they have addicted themselves to the ministry of the saints 
16:16 that ye submit yourselves unto such and to every one that helpeth with us and laboureth 
16:17 i am glad of the coming of stephanas and fortunatus and achaicus for that which was lacking on your part they have supplied 
16:18 for they have refreshed my spirit and yours therefore acknowledge ye them that are such 
16:19 the churches of asia salute you aquila and priscilla salute you much in the lord with the church that is in their house 
16:20 all the brethren greet you greet ye one another with an holy kiss 
16:21 the salutation of me paul with mine own hand 
16:22 if any man love not the lord jesus christ let him be anathema maranatha 
16:23 the grace of our lord jesus christ be with you 
16:24 my love be with you all in christ jesus amen
