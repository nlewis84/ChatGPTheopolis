1:1 the elder unto the elect lady and her children whom i love in the truth and not i only but also all they that have known the truth 
1:2 for the truths sake which dwelleth in us and shall be with us for ever 
1:3 grace be with you mercy and peace from god the father and from the lord jesus christ the son of the father in truth and love 
1:4 i rejoiced greatly that i found of thy children walking in truth as we have received a commandment from the father 
1:5 and now i beseech thee lady not as though i wrote a new commandment unto thee but that which we had from the beginning that we love one another 
1:6 and this is love that we walk after his commandments this is the commandment that as ye have heard from the beginning ye should walk in it 
1:7 for many deceivers are entered into the world who confess not that jesus christ is come in the flesh this is a deceiver and an antichrist 
1:8 look to yourselves that we lose not those things which we have wrought but that we receive a full reward 
1:9 whosoever transgresseth and abideth not in the doctrine of christ hath not god he that abideth in the doctrine of christ he hath both the father and the son 
1:10 if there come any unto you and bring not this doctrine receive him not into your house neither bid him god speed 
1:11 for he that biddeth him god speed is partaker of his evil deeds 
1:12 having many things to write unto you i would not write with paper and ink but i trust to come unto you and speak face to face that our joy may be full 
1:13 the children of thy elect sister greet thee amen
