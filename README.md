## 🌱 Initialize the Database

📘 **Seeding an Individual Book**

You can seed an individual book of the Bible by running the following command, substituting the appropriate path to the text file:

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"filePath": "GreekTexts/1_Corinthians_Greek.txt"}' http://localhost:3000/insert
```

📚 **Seeding the Entire Greek Bible**

You can seed the entire Greek Bible by running the following command:

```bash
yarn seed:greek
```

> ⏰ **Note:** This will take a few minutes to complete. Please be patient. The Synoptic Gospels (Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John) take the longest.
